# Dinner Dates & Rates
This application was created as part of a group project for one of my classes at St. John's University.
The goal was to create a social network / restaurant review application using JavaFX and MySQL.
Using this application, students and faculty could communicate, register for events around campus, and review the foods offered at local eateries.

Two other students also worked on this project:
* Klay-Michael Dehaney
* Harrison Bowen
